# Zootopia Animals Website

Zootopia Animals Website is a Python project that generates an HTML website displaying information about animals. The project fetches data from the API Ninjas Animals API
 and displays it as styled cards.

The problem it solves: instead of manually looking up animal details, users can enter an animal name and instantly get its type, diet, and location displayed in a neat, visually appealing HTML page.

Intended audience: anyone interested in learning about animals or practicing Python, APIs, and HTML generation.
